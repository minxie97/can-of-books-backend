## Collaboration:

#### Logistical
What hours will you be available to communicate?
9am-9pm
What platform will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?
Slack
How often will you take breaks?
Hourly or as needed
What is your plan if you start to fall behind?
Focus individual strengths to increase productivity. Ask TA's.
#### Cooperative
Make a list of each parson’s strengths.
Min:
- BackEnd coordination and knowledge. Time management
Kirk:
- Frontend execution and work flow.
How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?
Our plan is to work on our weaknesses, and if we start to fall behind, switch roles so we play to our strengths.
In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?
More practice & familiarty with the server/DB process.
Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?
Constant communication while building the apps. Daily stand-ups before starting our collab and reviewing what we went over after we finish for the day.
#### Conflict Resolution
What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?
Talk to them about our different roles, switch driver/nav often, potentially escalate to instructors.
What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?
We plan to switch roles often as to avoid this, but further discussion or instructor intervention if needed.
How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
Play to each others strengths and communicate to improve both of our knowledge levels.
