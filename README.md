## Collaboration:

#### Logistical
What hours will you be available to communicate?
9am-9pm
What platform will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?
Slack
How often will you take breaks?
Hourly or as needed
What is your plan if you start to fall behind?
Focus individual strengths to increase productivity. Ask TA's.
#### Cooperative
Make a list of each parson’s strengths.
Min:
- BackEnd coordination and knowledge. Time management
Kirk:
- Frontend execution and work flow.
How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?
Our plan is to work on our weaknesses, and if we start to fall behind, switch roles so we play to our strengths.
In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?
More practice & familiarty with the server/DB process.
Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?
Constant communication while building the apps. Daily stand-ups before starting our collab and reviewing what we went over after we finish for the day.
#### Conflict Resolution
What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?
Talk to them about our different roles, switch driver/nav often, potentially escalate to instructors.
What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?
We plan to switch roles often as to avoid this, but further discussion or instructor intervention if needed.
How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
Play to each others strengths and communicate to improve both of our knowledge levels.


# Project Name Can of books

**Author**: Kirk Garrison & Min Xie
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
This application allows a user to log in, and view a collection of books. They can add new books, update their current collection of books, and delete books from their collection. 
We used the RESTful methods to implement these features, as well as Auth0 for securely logging into your profile.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
They must be familiar with React and axios, as well as using the RESTful methods. You would need familiarity with API server's and how they communicate with a front end website to provide information.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
This application was designed with React, JavaScript, React-Bootstrap, React-router, Axios, CSS, and Auth0

## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource. -->
11/08/2021 6:40pm - Application set up completed. Both Front and Back-end. Mongoose brought in with schema and keys.
Get route functioning so user now has collection of books upon login.
11/09/2021 6:30pm - Application now has Post and Delete methods functioning. Added Modal form so the user can input information about the book they are adding, and view that book inside of their collection. User can now also delete any book present in their collection.
11/10/2021 6:15pm - Application now has update form for their book collection. The user can now click to update their book, and a form populates allowing them to edit details about any of their books.
11/13/2021 6:30pm - Application now has Auth0 authentication added. The user may sign in with Auth0 securely and their book collection is presented upon login.
